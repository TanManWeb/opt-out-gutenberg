# Opt Out Gutenberg
A very simple and lightweight plugin that will disable the Gutenberg block editor and restore the Classic editor in WordPress for all post types. There are no settings to mess around with. Just install and activate.

## What makes this plugin different?
There are several plugins available in the WordPress Plugin Directory for disabling the Gutenberg block editor. However, some are overly complicated to use. Others leave traces of Gutenberg in the ```<head></head>``` tags of your WordPress website source code specifically ```'wp-block-library-css'``` and ```'wp-block-library-theme-css'```. 

This plugin aims to fix that. Once activated, this plugin will restore the classic editor in your WordPress backend and will also remove ```'wp-block-library-css'``` and ```'wp-block-library-theme-css'``` that appear between the ```<head></head>``` tags of your WordPress website source code.
